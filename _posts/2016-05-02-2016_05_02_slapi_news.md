Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

This week is what I consider the most important and valuable updates on SL API News, we got some removes, and this can break some existing code... so let's check what changed so you can keep your code up to date.

## SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Cart

The data types was removed, including its items `SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order_Cart_Item`

## SoftLayer_Network_Component_Detail

This other datatype was removed too.

## SoftLayer_Software_Component_AntivirusSpyware

On message `updateAntivirusSpywarePolicy`, it now accepts an `enforce` parameter, that is a boolean type.

Keep your code update to date and see you next week!
