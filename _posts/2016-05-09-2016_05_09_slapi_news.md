Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

This week is probably the tiniest update ever! :)

50% of updates are related to a type on api doc, I think nobody would see without a diff :P

## SoftLayer_Network_Subnet

Fields `totalIpAddresses` and `usableIpAddressCount` are changed from `nonNegativeInteger` to `decimal` (in WSDL) and on ruby it results in a change from Integer to Float.

## SoftLayer_User_Customer_Link

Added a `defaultFlag` (Integer) field.

This way we finish a very calm week in the _SL API World_â„¢

See you next week!
