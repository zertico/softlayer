Stay updated about modifications on SoftLayer API, read our [page]({{ site.url }}/softlayer_updates) to know more information about these updates.

## Account_Authentication_OpenIdConnect_Option

This option datatypes was created to be used on `User_Customer_OpenIdConnect#generateAuthorizationEndpointUrl`, it has only two values:

* `key`
* `value`

So can pass a lot of key/value pairs representing some options

## Virtual_Guest

Added a new `executeRemoteScript` method that download and run remote script from uri on the virtual guest. Requires https for script to be executed after download.

See you next week!
